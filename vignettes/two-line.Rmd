```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(morphmat)
```

Here I will write a vignette explaining all of the two-line regression methods. This will be useful for referring readers to more complex options available in packages like `chngpt` that are not available within `morphmat`.

# Two-line Stevens

# Two-line with logistic transition

# chngpt stegmented
