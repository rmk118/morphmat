A compilation of methods used to estimate size at (sexual) maturity based on morphometric data, most commonly applied to crabs, lobsters, and other crustaceans. Approaches include modeling approaches based on piecewise/segmented linear regression as well as numerous clustering-based methods.

`morphmat` is intended to help fisheries scientists and managers to implement the multitude of computational methods that have been developed for estimating crustacean size at maturity. This package is being developed as part of my graduate work at the University of Maine. **This is still a work in progress and should not yet be used for research purposes.**

`morphmat` will include user-friendly functions for estimating size at morphometric maturity, along with guidelines for choosing the optimal method for a given dataset and correctly interpreting results. Both novel and historically popular (e.g., broken-stick regression) methods will be included, and users will be able to obtain SM50 estimates from nearly a dozen different approaches with a single function call. By combining code for the various models within a single package, morphmat will enable the application of multi-model inference to SM50 estimation, avoiding the arbitrary selection of a single “best” model [@katsanevakis2006]. By increasing the accessibility of modern statistical methods for estimating SM50, I hope to facilitate the widespread adoption of improved SM50 modeling procedures.

`morphmat` will include versions of the methods implemented in these existing GitHub repositories:

The following scripts do not use morphometric data and require individuals to already be classified as mature or immature. They provide various examples of how to fit maturity\~length binomial models to estimate SM50 and obtain confidence intervals. These tools can also be used to calculate size at maturity for non-crustacean fisheries. For a comprehensive examination of this type of model, see Mainguy et al [-@mainguy2024].

## Installation

You can install the development version of morphmat from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rmk118/morphmat")
```

## Examples

```{r example_generate}
library(morphmat)

set.seed(12) # for reproducibility when generating the simulated data

# Generate a simulated dataset with known size at maturity
fc <- fake_crustaceans(
  error_scale = 17,
  slope = 9,
  L50 = 75,
  n = 800,
  allo_params = c(0.9, 0.25, 1.05, 0.2),
  x_mean = 85
)
```

### Broken-stick/piecewise regression methods

REGRANS:

```{r}
regrans(fc, "x", "y", verbose = FALSE)
```

Two-line logistic:

```{r}
two_line_logistic(fc, xvar = "x", yvar = "y", verbose = FALSE, SM50_start = 85)
```

Two-line model (lines are fit separately; no forced intersection):

```{r}
two_line(fc, xvar = "x", yvar = "y", verbose = FALSE)
```

Broken-stick Stevens (only iterates over values of the x-axis variable present in the data):

```{r}
broken_stick_stevens(fc, xvar = "x", yvar = "y", verbose = FALSE)
```

Other packages:

```{r}
# segmented
# chngpt
```

Compare estimates from all piecewise regression methods:

```{r}
piecewise_mods(fc, xvar = "x", yvar = "y", method = "all")
```

### Clustering methods

Somerton method:

```{r}
out_df <- somerton(fc, xvar = "x", yvar = "y")[[1]]
mod <- glm(data = out_df, pred_mat_num ~ x, family = binomial(link = "logit"))
unname(-coef(mod)[1] / coef(mod)[2])
```
