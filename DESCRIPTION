Description: A compilation of methods used to estimate size at (sexual)
    maturity based on morphometric data, most commonly applied to crabs,
    lobsters, and other crustaceans. Approaches include modeling
    approaches based on piecewise/segmentedlinear regression as well as
    numerous clustering-based methods.
